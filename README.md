## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS3 Preprocessor
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React Toolkit
- [Slugify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify) - Slugify package
- [react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive) - React-responsive package
- [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) - PropTypes package for props validation
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - Chai package for testing components


### Continued development & what I learned

I would like to learn how to efficiently refactoring my code in my Components. There's a repetition on hooks & some functions and I would like to avoid that from now on.

I know now I need to code my applications with a mobile-first workflow, this will avoid repetitions in CSS and will make responsivness easier and quicker to desktop & tablets :wink:

I should have done my test while making my components rather than test after the whole app was done.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - Because why shouldn't I use this ? :D
- [Josh Comeau's blog - Embracing modern image formats](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/performance/embracing-modern-image-formats/) - For some knowledge about webp & PNG images


## Future Updates
I would like to add some animations to make the website more smooth :
- [ ] For transitions between pages
- [ ] On the slide's images
- [ ] On navigation bar when clicking on a link
- [ ] On burger menu when clicking on the open/close icon
