- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS3 Preprocessor
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React Toolkit
- [Slugify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify) - Slugify package

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to efficiently refactoring my code in my Components. There's a repetition on hooks & some functions and I would like to avoid that from now on.

I know now I need to code my applications with a mobile-first workflow, will be easier and quicker to adapt to desktop & tablets :wink:
